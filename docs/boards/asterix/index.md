# Asterix

## Programming

The Asterix board provides a B2B (Board-To-Board) connector that gives access to:

- MCU VDD, VUSB and GND
- MCU SWCLK, SWDIO and RESET
- Debug UART RX/TX

The connector part number is Molex 5050040812, and the pinout is as shown below.

The "Core B2B v2" board has been designed as a companion programming board.
It is based on the [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html).
Below you can find a picture on how it is connected, and a list of its main features.

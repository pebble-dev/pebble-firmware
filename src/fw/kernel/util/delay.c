  // Subtract consumes 1 cycle & the conditional branch consumes 1 + P (pipeline fill delay,
  // 1-3 cycles) if the branch is taken, or 1 if not taken. For this situation, it appears that P=1
  // on the STM32F2/F4, so the loop takes 3 and 2 cycles respectively. The Cortex-M7 (STM32F7) has a
  // superscalar dual-issue architecture which allows for 1-cycle loops (including the subtract).
  //
  // @ 64MHz 1 instructions is ~15.6ns which translates to the previously measured 47ns for one loop
  // Thus we can derive that to get a duration of 1Âµs from an arbitrary clock frequency the count
  // value needs to be:
  //    count = 1e-6 / (1/F * 3) where F is the core clock frequency
  //
  // An additional note is that delay_us is always executed from flash. The
  // instruction cache in the cortex M3 & M4 cores is pretty good at saving
  // instructions with simple branches which means we don't stall on flash
  // reads after the first loop. Counterintuitively, executing from SRAM
  // actually adds a extra delay cycle on instruction fetches and can be
  // stalled if peripherals are doing DMAs. (See PBL-22265 for more details)

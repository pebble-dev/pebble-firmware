//!   \brief Functions related to getting the battery status
//!
//! This module contains the functions necessary to find the current charge status.
//! @note Battery charge state is a complex topic; our modelling of the charge
//! that is exposed by these functions represents a very simplified model based
//! mostly on empirically derived charge and discharge voltage curves.  As
//! such, you should expect that the output will not have a high degree of
//! accuracy.

//! Structure for retrieval of the battery charge state
typedef struct {
  //! A percentage (0-100) of how full the battery is
  uint8_t charge_percent;
  //! True if the battery is currently being charged. False if not.
  bool is_charging;
  //! True if the charger cable is connected. False if not.
  bool is_plugged;

//! Structure for retrieval of the exact battery charge state
typedef struct {
  //! The battery's percentage as a ratio32
  uint32_t charge_percent;

  //! the user-facing defintion of whether we're charging (100% battery).
